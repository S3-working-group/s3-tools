Integrate with other repos:
	s3handbook contains build code for handbook in pdf/epub/web version
- decide what to merge from handbook, and how to do this.  It's probably a good idea to move all that stuff into one repository (mdtools?)
- move all slide deck code to mdtools so mdtools contains everything to build and manipulate Markdown slidedecks @done(2017-07-05)
- move all code from s3 handbook into this repo so all specific code for  working with patterns is contained here
